        <b>
        Pixar’s Finding Nemo earned its place as an animated classic thanks in large part to the depth of its characters.
        While the story of one adorable clownfish’s dangerous trek through the wild and his father’s persistent quest to
        recover him at any cost resonates on a human level, the diverse and well-sketched personalities of the
        surrounding cast are part of what brings the story to such vibrant life. From a trio of vegetarian sharks to a
        grumpy porcupine fish, Pixar’s story introduces a whole new generation to a variety of underwater species, and
        both play with and against our popular understanding of many aquatic creatures.
